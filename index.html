        <h2>Lubumbashi, Democratic Republic of the Congo </h2>
        <img src="images/flag_drc.png" alt="Flag of the Democratic Republic of the Congo" width="200">
        <p>The Democratic Republic of the Congo is a country located in Central Africa. It is the second-largest country in Africa by area and the eleventh-largest in the world. The country is known for its rich natural resources, including minerals such as cobalt and copper. The Congo River, the second-longest river in Africa, flows through the country, providing a vital waterway for transportation and trade. Despite its natural wealth, the country faces challenges such as political instability and poverty. The capital city is Kinshasa, which is also the largest city in the country. <br>
        The country has a diverse culture with over 200 ethnic groups and numerous languages spoken. French is the official language, while Lingala, Swahili, Kikongo, and Tshiluba are also widely spoken. The country's music, particularly soukous, has gained international recognition. The wildlife in the Congo Basin, including gorillas, elephants, and okapis, is also notable. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect these species and their habitats.
